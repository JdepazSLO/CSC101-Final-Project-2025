(POC) refers to (Parameter Occurrence Code). This is a specific air monitor at a single location.
For example, if an air quality monitoring station has two ozone monitors,
the first one might be assigned POC 1, and the second POC 2.

(PPM) refers to (parts per million). 1 ppm is practically equivalent to 1 mg/L

(AQI VALUE) refers to the level of air quality, scaled 1-500.
Good (0-50)
Moderate (51-100)
Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups (101-150)
Unhealthy (151-200)
Very Unhealthy (201-300)
Hazardous (301-500)
